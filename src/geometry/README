         GeometryEstimator class

/*********************************************************************/

GeometryEstimator class takes care of learning and understanding the geometry 
of the scene. This information is used for detection, background, etc

The following methods are present in the class, described briefly:

(a) detectVanishPoint:
    Detecting the vanishing point from a single image using Gabor filters, as
    proposed by the paper:
    http://imagine.enpc.fr/~audibert/Mes%20articles/CVPR09.pdf

(b) detectRoadBoundary:
    Detecting the boundaries of the road, based on the vanishing point and 
    orientation map from detectVanishPoint, related to the same paper as above.

(c) computeHoughLanes:
    Computing the hough lines using the transform.

(d) computeIPTransform:
    This function finds the homography corresponding to the inverse perspective
    map of the road, based on the vanishing point and lane boundaries.

(e) generateRoadBelief:
    Using the inverse perspective transformation and lane boundaries. The background
    is used to get the lanes based on the activity. Hough lines are also used for lane
    identification.

(f)
